**What question should the reference manual answer?**

Please describe what the reference manual should enable you to do that you can't do right now. Ideally, this is phrased in terms of a question, like "How are strings represented in compiled code?".

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the question here that will help us ensure that the documentation meets your needs.
